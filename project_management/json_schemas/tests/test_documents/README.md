For these tests, we take a "make sure these errors are caught" approach.
Each test file, except those labeled "good_sample", have at least one problem in them that should not pass verification.


Being clear: Each of these JSON files, aside from the "good_sample" files should fail verification. If they don't, then he associated JSON schema file has a bug that needs addressing.
